Here's an explanation of the approach used in this code:

s.split(): The split() method is used to split the input string s into a list of words. By default, it splits the string at spaces (whitespace characters), effectively separating the words. For example, "Hello World" becomes ["Hello", "World"].

s[::-1]: After splitting the string into words, the list of words is reversed using slicing with [::-1]. This reverses the order of elements in the list, effectively reversing the order of words. For example, ["Hello", "World"] becomes ["World", "Hello"].

" ".join(...): Finally, the reversed list of words is joined back into a single string using the join() method. This method joins the elements of the list using a space as a separator, effectively creating a string with the reversed word order. For example, ["World", "Hello"] becomes "World Hello".

Complexity
Time complexity: O(n + m)
Space complexity: O(n + m)
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        s= s.split()
        return " ".join(s[::-1])

        ##        stringbuilder.appendleft(s[start:i])
